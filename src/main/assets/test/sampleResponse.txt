                    "text": "<p>A reciprocal agreement (reciprocity) allows residents of one state to request exemption from withholding for wages earned in a second state.</p>\n<p>This simplifies tax preparation because the employee only needs to file one state tax return instead of two (one for your resident state and one for the nonresident state you earned income in).</p>\n<p><strong>For example:</strong><br />\nYou live in state A, but work across the river in state B, and these states have a reciprocal agreement. Have your employer in state B withhold state taxes for state A instead of state B. You must request an exemption from state B withholding by filling out a form for that state. The employer may also be able to withhold taxes for state A for you. Now you only have to file a tax return for state A, your resident state, and save the cost of a second state tax program!</p>\n<p>The list below shows the exemption form you'll need. If you fail to tell your employer or fill out the exemption form, you will have to file a tax return for state B to get your withheld taxes refunded, and then pay the tax due in state A.</p>\n<p>But should these states <strong>not</strong> have a reciprocal agreement (do not have reciprocity), your employer in state B is required to withhold taxes for state B. Every year you would have to file a nonresident return for state B to get your withheld taxes back. In many, but not all cases, state B would recognize state A as your normal tax home and not tax your income. After completing your nonresident tax return (state B), you'd complete your tax return for state A. Should state B tax your nonresident income, state A should give you a credit for taxes paid in state B.</p><h2>States with reciprocity agreements</h2><p>The chart below shows the current list of reciprocal states and a link to each state's <strong>exemption form</strong>.

                    "clean": "A reciprocal agreement (reciprocity) allows residents of one state to request exemption from withholding for wages earned in a second state.\nThis simplifies tax preparation because the employee only needs to file one state tax return instead of two (one for your resident state and one for the nonresident state you earned income in).\nFor example:\nYou live in state A, but work across the river in state B, and these states have a reciprocal agreement. Have your employer in state B withhold state taxes for state A instead of state B. You must request an exemption from state B withholding by filling out a form for that state. The employer may also be able to withhold taxes for state A for you. Now you only have to file a tax return for state A, your resident state, and save the cost of a second state tax program!\nThe list below shows the exemption form you'll need. If you fail to tell your employer or fill out the exemption form, you will have to file a tax return for state B to get your withheld taxes refunded, and then pay the tax due in state A.\nBut should these states\nnot\nhave a reciprocal agreement (do not have reciprocity), your employer in state B is required to withhold taxes for state B. Every year you would have to file a nonresident return for state B to get your withheld taxes back. In many, but not all cases, state B would recognize state A as your normal tax home and not tax your income. After completing your nonresident tax return (state B), you'd complete your tax return for state A. Should state B tax your nonresident income, state A should give you a credit for taxes paid in state B.\nStates with reciprocity agreements\nThe chart below shows the current list of reciprocal states and a link to each state's\nexemption form\n. States not listed below do not have reciprocal agreements.\nImportant:\nIf you request your employer to stop withholding taxes for the state you work in, ask if they can withhold taxes for your resident state instead. Some employers can do this, but if yours cannot, you should make\nquarterly estimated tax payments\nto your resident state to avoid possible underpayment penalties and interest.\n \nIf you work in...\nAnd you are a resident of...\nSubmit this exemption form to your employer\nDistrict of Columbia\n                        anywhere other than the District of Columbia\n                        D-4A\n                    \n                    \n                        Illinois\n                        Iowa, Kentucky, Michigan, or Wisconsin\n                        IL-W-5-NR\n                    \n                    \n                        Indiana\n                        Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, or Wisconsin\n                        WH-47\n                    \n                    \n                        Iowa\n                        Illinois\n                        44-016\n                    \n                    \n                        Kentucky\n                        Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Virginia, West Virginia, or Wisconsin\n                        42A809\n                    \n                    \n                        Maryland\n                        District of Columbia, Pennsylvania, Virginia, or West Virginia\n                        MW 507\n                    \n                    \n                        Michigan\n                        Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Minnesota, Ohio, or Wisconsin\n                        MI-W4\n                    \n                    \n                        Minnesota\n                        Michigan or North Dakota\n                        MWR\n                    \n                    \n                        Montana\n                        North Dakota\n                        NR-2\n                    \n                    \n                        New Jersey\n                        Pennsylvania\n                        NJ-165\n                    \n                    \n                        North Dakota\n                        Minnesota or Montana\n                        NDW-R\n                    \n                    \n                        Ohio\n                        Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Pennsylvania, or West Virginia\n                        IT-4NR\n                    \n                    \n                        Pennsylvania\n                        Indiana, Maryland, New Jersey, Ohio, Virginia, or West Virginia\n                        REV-419\n                    \n                    \n                        Virginia\n                        District of Columbia, Kentucky, Maryland, Pennsylvania, or West Virginia\n                        VA-4\n                    \n                    \n                        West Virginia\n                        Kentucky, Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania, or Virginia\n                        WV/IT-104R\n                    \n                    \n                        Wisconsin\n                        Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, or Michigan\n                        W-220\nGEN84213\n",
